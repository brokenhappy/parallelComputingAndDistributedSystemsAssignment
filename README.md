# parallel computing and distributed systems assignment
In this assignment I have to come up with some algorithm and create a simple single threaded implementation.

I choose an algorithm that traverses the graph of all internal links of a certain website and counts the occurences of all words.

The chosen website to scrape is guimp.com. It is a small website (litterally). 
This means the server wont be overloaded by the requests, the graph is small enough to traverse, and there is probably no bot protection
